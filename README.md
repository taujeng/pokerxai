## Under Construction!

## Introduction

This app was made for Poker, specifically Texas hold'em. The user can select his hand
from the selection of playing cards. After some calculations, ChatGpt will let you know
the relative hand strength of your current hand, as well as the chances of a straight or flush.

## Credit

The original cards were created by Chris Aguilar. The Ace of Spades was by Byron Knoll.
They were optimized by Mike Hall with help from Warren Lockhart.
